# Work of the First week! 
As I have already signed up in github. So I will not mention it there.
## 1.Git install 
Download git install package from [https://www.git-scm.com/download/](). I downloaded different version packages for Windows and MacOs. Then just click the package and select all default radio button. After finishing installing, then I will be able to use git command in cmd.
## 2.Account config
To config local user name and email, I use following commands:

```
git config --global user.name yangwenhao
git config --global user.email 874681044@qq.com
```

Then I go to config directory and create local ssh files by using following command:

```
cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "874681044@qq.com"
```
After that, I paste the content that is in file **id_rsa.pub** into github ssh adding textarea. At the same time, these two SSH keys are named after my different laptops of operating systems.
## 3.Create local directory
In my learning directory, I make a directory named MES as base directory. In cmd, I use following commands to create initialize a new respository and clone remote respository of our group. 

```
git init
git clone https://github.com/SoftwarEngineeringGroup/Daily-Work
```
## 4.Add remote respository
Copy my project url for add remote respository.

```
git add remote ywh https://github.com:Wenhao-Yang/Daily-Work.git
```

If adding succeeds, run following `git remote -v` will get such return:

```
ywh	https://github.com/Wenhao-Yang/Daily-Work.git (fetch)
ywh	https://github.com/Wenhao-Yang/Daily-Work.git (push)
```

## 5.Upload file for test
Create file named GitInstallYWH.txt to upload. There are three steps, and all of them could be done by commands.

```
git add GitInstallYWH.txt 
git commit -m "upload txt file for test"
git push
```

Then check if our operation is successful by opening [https://github.com/Wenhao-Yang/Daily-Work]() and searching for *GitInstallYWH.txt*.
## 6.Join the group team
Invited by the group owner, I was authorized with full access to our project. Fork our team respository to my workstation, so I can get the code from my remote respository with following commands:

```
git fetch origin master
git merge origin/master
git commit -m '合并到本地'
```
