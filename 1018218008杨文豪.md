# Work of the First week! 
As I have already signed up in github. So I will not mention it there.
## 1.Git install 
Download git install package from [https://www.git-scm.com/download/](). I downloaded different version packages for Windows and MacOs. Then just click the package and select all default radio button. After finishing installing, then I will be able to use git command in cmd.
## 2.Account config
To config local user name and email, I use following commands:

```
git config --global user.name yangwenhao
git config --global user.email 874681044@qq.com
```

Then I go to config directory and create local ssh files by using following command:

```
cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "874681044@qq.com"
```
After that, I paste the content that is in file **id_rsa.pub** into github ssh adding textarea. At the same time, these two SSH keys are named after my different laptops of operating systems.
## 3.Create local directory
In my learning directory, I make a directory named MES as base directory. In cmd, I use following commands to create initialize a new respository and clone remote respository of our group. 

```
git init
git clone https://github.com/SoftwarEngineeringGroup/Daily-Work
```
## 4.Add remote respository
Copy my project url for add remote respository.

```
git add remote ywh https://github.com:Wenhao-Yang/Daily-Work.git
```

If adding succeeds, run following `git remote -v` will get such return:

```
ywh	https://github.com/Wenhao-Yang/Daily-Work.git (fetch)
ywh	https://github.com/Wenhao-Yang/Daily-Work.git (push)
```

## 5.Upload file for test
Create file named GitInstallYWH.txt to upload. There are three steps, and all of them could be done by commands.

```
git add GitInstallYWH.txt 
git commit -m "upload txt file for test"
git push
```

Then check if our operation is successful by opening [https://github.com/Wenhao-Yang/Daily-Work]() and searching for *GitInstallYWH.txt*.
## 6.Join the group team
Invited by the group owner, I was authorized with full access to our project. Fork our team respository to my workstation, so I can get the code from my remote respository with following commands:

```
git fetch origin master
git merge origin/master
git commit -m '合并到本地'
```

# Work of the second week!
This week, I read the code of project Sketch2Code. And I give my opinion about it. 
## 1.Overview
Using C#, Sketch2Code is a web solution for transform manuscript website to HTML. In cloud, AI is able to recognize controllers in imagines. And there are five modules.

-  A Microsoft Custom Vision Model: This model has been trained with images of different handwritten designs tagging the information of most common HTML elements like Buttons, TextBox and Image.
-  A Microsoft Computer Vision Service: To identify the text written into a design element a Computer Vision Service is used.
-  An Azure Blob Storage: All steps involved in the HTML generation process are stored, including original image, prediction results and layout grouping information.
-  An Azure Function: Serves as the backend entry point that coordinates the generation process by interacting with all the services.
-  An Azure Web App: User front-end to enable uploading a new design and see the generated HTML results. 

## 2.Source Code
There are five projects in Sketch2Code. For projects named BoxGeometryTest and GeometryUI, the author didn't share the code. And Sketch2Code.Tests can't be loaded in MacOS as it's programmed for Windows. And I won't discuss more about it here.

## 3.Website
Visiting [https://sketch2code.azurewebsites.net/](https://sketch2code.azurewebsites.net/), I've test some function of this project and find some problems.

### a.Image Upload
When I upload my design, there's no feedback during uploading. As I waited for almost 30s, uploading page come out.
### b.Handwriting Recogonition
Handwriting Recogonition in the project is not perfect as I expected. Except for Chinese recognition problems, there's mistakes even when I uploaded an image of printed web page.

### c.Web Page
In my opinion, there should be HTML code display in the page. In the future, we may contribute to design fuction that users may get visual code representation display.
